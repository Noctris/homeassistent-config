# Homeassistant Config V2 Revamp


My current home assistant setup has became too bulky because I was doing tests on the daily production version. 

The new setup has a dev and prod environment and aims for the following improvements:

- Only integrate what we use
- New interfaces
- Node red automations instead of home assistant built in
- Move over the automations we have in use to node-red and clean them up
- Back to git tracking of the config
